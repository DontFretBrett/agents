# Agentic AI Engineering - Learning Resources Summary

Agentic AI Engineering focuses on designing and building AI systems that act autonomously as agents, capable of planning, reasoning, and interacting in complex environments. Below is a summary of key resources and learning paths for mastering Agentic AI Engineering:

## 1. GitHub Repository: Learn Agentic AI (Panaversity)
- Comprehensive open-source guide and course program covering Agentic AI using the Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA) design pattern.
- Integrates core technologies: OpenAI Agents SDK, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent2Agent (A2A) communication, Dapr runtime, Kubernetes, etc.
- Emphasizes AI-first and cloud-native development for scalable, resilient agentic systems.
- Multi-level courses (AI-201, AI-202, AI-301) teach fundamentals, cloud deployments, and planetary-scale multi-agent systems.
- Includes hands-on tutorials and quizzes on topics like FastAPI, containerization, stateful workflows, voice agents, LLM fine-tuning, and more.
- Repository link: https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai

## 2. Core Concepts and Frameworks
- **OpenAI Agents SDK:** Minimal Python-first framework for building agents with direct control and simple abstractions.
- **Dapr Agents:** Event-driven stateful virtual actors with Kubernetes integration for large-scale deployments.
- Other frameworks include CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK, LangGraph, each with unique abstraction and control levels.

## 3. Learning Path Highlights
- Understanding agentic AI theory and design patterns.
- Proficiency in Python, async programming, and prompt engineering.
- Using Dapr for state management, pub/sub, workflows, and service invocation.
- Building containerized applications with Kubernetes and Rancher Desktop.
- Developing advanced multi-agent communication protocols and monitoring.

## 4. Quizzes and Evaluations
- Rigorous quizzes testing deep understanding of OpenAI Agents SDK internals, multi-agent workflows, and protocol design.
- Preparation involves studying SDK docs, prompt engineering guides, and practical coding exercises.

## 5. Additional Resources
- Video playlists for supplementary learning.
- Documentation links such as OpenAI Agents SDK, OpenAI prompt engineering cookbook, Markdown guides.
